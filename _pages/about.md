Program Officer with data analysis skills, looking to take the next step in his career as a Data Analyst.

Just like his birthplace, Tokyo, Sunjin David Kim is an intersection of ingenuity and logic. You will find him solving challenging problems with grit, or seeking new knowledge and opportunities to grow. He is a natural leader and team player that brings out the best in people and creates a positive vibe. He is a pleasure to be around. I should know...I'm stuck with him for life...and I still like him :)
